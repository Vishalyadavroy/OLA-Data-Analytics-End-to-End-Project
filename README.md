- Removing duplicates.
- Joining multiple datasets (rides, payments, customers).
- Performed sanity checks in Excel for verification.

## 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified most profitable cities & routes.
- Analyzed ride frequency by customer type (new vs repeat).
- Studied driver performance & ratings trends.
- Found peak ride booking hours and payment method preferences.

## 4️⃣ Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

## Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with the following KPIs:

- 🚖 Total Rides
- 💰 Total Revenue & Avg. Fare per Ride
- 📍 Top 5 Cities by Revenue
- ⏰ Peak Booking Hours
- 👤 New vs Returning Customers
- ⭐ Driver Ratings Distribution
- 💳 Payment Method Analysis

 ## 📊 Key Insights
